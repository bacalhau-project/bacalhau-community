# Bacalhau Community Guidelines

Welcome to the [Baclahau Community](https://www.bacalhau.org/). 

This is a dedicated space for you to network with others, expand your knowledge and ask questions about Bacalhau and distributed computing.
You could be here to get an answer to a question or problem, to inquire about Bacalhay, or figure out a use case for building on Bacalhau.

Our mission is to nurture and grow the [Baclahau Community](https://www.bacalhau.org/) and we are committed to hosting a space where our actions align with our vision and purpose. 

We developed the following community guidelines to provide guidance on how to engage with other users in the community and what you should expect from others. 

*These guidelines are first and foremost useful for the Community, so the Community will be the main actor responsible for manteinance and continuous review. Everyone is welcome to participate in this document and comment/ask for changes.*

## The Bacalhau Slack Channel

The Slack channel is the main community platform. The basic rules for the Slack channel in regards to promotion and product are: 
* Things you can do: Post links to your own website/product, promote your talks, promote your meetups, connect with others in the allocated spaces as specified below.
* Things you can't do: Only post self-promotional posts/comments; send unsolicited private messages to members about your self-promotional content; use redirects to obfuscate your self-promotional content.

It is comprised of a list of channels that are represented down below (*this list is not complete and is ever-changing dependent on community wishes*):
